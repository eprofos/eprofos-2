# Chapter Management Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive chapter management functionality to the EPROFOS platform, ensuring full compliance with Qualiopi 2.5 requirements for pedagogical content structuring.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Chapter Entity
- **Basic Information**: Title, slug, description, duration, order index
- **Pedagogical Content (Qualiopi Compliant)**:
  - Learning objectives (specific and measurable)
  - Learning outcomes (expected results)
  - Content outline (structured plan)
  - Prerequisites (required knowledge/skills)
  - Teaching methods (pedagogical approaches)
  - Assessment methods (evaluation techniques)
  - Resources and materials (educational content)
  - Success criteria (measurable indicators)

### 2. Chapter Repository
- Advanced querying capabilities with filtering
- Order management for chapter sequences
- Duration calculation utilities
- Status management (active/inactive)

### 3. Chapter Form (ChapterType)
- Dynamic collection fields for arrays (objectives, outcomes, resources, criteria)
- Module selection with formatted display
- Validation constraints
- Help text for Qualiopi compliance

### 4. Chapter Fixtures
- Realistic test data generation
- Context-aware chapter titles based on module topics
- Qualiopi-compliant content generation
- Proper relationships with modules

### 5. Admin Controller (ChapterController)
- Full CRUD operations
- Advanced filtering and search
- Bulk operations (reorder, duplicate)
- Status management
- Statistics dashboard

### 6. Admin Templates
- **Index**: Comprehensive chapter listing with filters
- **New/Edit**: Form with pedagogical sections
- **Show**: Detailed chapter view with all information
- **Statistics**: Analytics dashboard

### 7. Navigation Integration
- Added to admin sidebar under Formations
- Quick access from module management
- Breadcrumb navigation

## Qualiopi 2.5 Compliance

The implementation ensures compliance with Qualiopi 2.5 requirements by including:

1. **Structured Learning Objectives**: Clear, measurable objectives for each chapter
2. **Defined Learning Outcomes**: Expected results and capabilities
3. **Content Planning**: Detailed outline of what will be covered
4. **Prerequisite Documentation**: Required knowledge and skills
5. **Teaching Methods**: Pedagogical approaches used
6. **Assessment Methods**: How learning is evaluated
7. **Resource Documentation**: Materials and tools provided
8. **Success Criteria**: Measurable indicators of achievement

## Database Schema

The Chapter entity includes the following key fields:
- `learning_objectives` (JSON): Array of specific learning objectives
- `learning_outcomes` (JSON): Array of expected outcomes
- `content_outline` (TEXT): Structured content plan
- `prerequisites` (TEXT): Required knowledge/skills
- `teaching_methods` (TEXT): Pedagogical approaches
- `assessment_methods` (TEXT): Evaluation methods
- `resources` (JSON): Array of educational resources
- `success_criteria` (JSON): Array of success indicators

## Usage

### Admin Access
1. Navigate to Admin → Formations → Chapitres
2. Use filters to find specific chapters
3. Create new chapters with all required Qualiopi information
4. Manage chapter order within modules
5. View statistics and analytics

### Key Features
- **Filtering**: By module, formation, status, or search terms
- **Ordering**: Drag-and-drop reordering within modules
- **Duplication**: Quick chapter copying
- **Statistics**: Usage analytics and metrics
- **Bulk Operations**: Toggle status, reorder, etc.

## Next Steps

For the complete educational structure, the following should be implemented next:

1. **Course Entity**: Individual lessons within chapters
2. **Exercise Entity**: Interactive exercises for practice
3. **QCM Entity**: Multiple choice questions for assessment
4. **Progress Tracking**: Student progress through content
5. **Certification**: Completion certificates

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive fixtures for testing:
- 3-8 chapters per module
- Realistic content based on formation topics
- Proper Qualiopi-compliant information
- Various durations and complexity levels

Run fixtures with:
```bash
docker compose exec php php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

## Migration

A migration has been created to add the new fields to the database:
```bash
docker compose exec php php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the chapter management system while maintaining full Qualiopi compliance and providing an excellent user experience for administrators.
